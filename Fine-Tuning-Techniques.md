**Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA):----**
Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a technique for fine-tuning language models by adding low-rank matrices to the model’s layers. This allows for efficient fine-tuning while preserving the model’s pre-trained knowledge. One of the key benefits of LoRA is the significant memory savings it offers, making it possible to fine-tune large models on hardware with limited resources.
